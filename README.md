#Introduction

Early days, this is my first themeing experiment for Drupal 8 and is
the theme for running-on-drupal8.com using ExpressionEngine.

The theme shares the same css as my blog personal site chris-david-hall.info
(bar one line), which is a testement to the greater ease of de-drupalification
of Drupal 8. 

This is just for interest, this would not be useful as base theme or for any
other custom development. 

#Bootstrap based
Based on Bootstrap 3 at the moment but the css is a little stripped down and 
the js has been replaced with 
[tagwa/bootstrap-without-jquery](https://github.com/tagawa/bootstrap-without-jquery)

#Going forward

Still a lot more to strip out, and bugs to investigate (which may or may not be
be Drupally bugs at the moment).

Also it already had lots of things wrong with it, on the original theme.  

This may develop into something more interesting depending on which directions
my experiments go in.
